  Version 1.2, November 2002

  Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple
  Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
 </p><p>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 </p><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.5"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">PREAMBLE</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.5">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document “free” in the sense of
   freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
   redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
   noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
   publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
   responsible for modifications made by others.
  </p><p>
   This License is a kind of <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">copyleft</span>”</span>, which means that
   derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
   sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.
  </p><p>
   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
   does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
   for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
   published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
   works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.6"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.6"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.6">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
   distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
   world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
   under the conditions stated herein. The <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Document</span>”</span>, below,
   refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
   licensee, and is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">you</span>”</span>. You accept the license
   if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
   under copyright law.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Modified Version</span>”</span> of the Document means any work
   containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Secondary Section</span>”</span> is a named appendix or a front-matter
   section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
   the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
   with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
   philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Invariant Sections</span>”</span> are certain Secondary Sections
   whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
   notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
   section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
   allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
   Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
   Sections then there are none.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Cover Texts</span>”</span> are certain short passages of text that
   are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
   says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
   may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Transparent</span>”</span> copy of the Document means a
   machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
   available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
   document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
   composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
   for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
   file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
   thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
   Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Transparent</span>”</span>
   is called <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Opaque</span>”</span>.
  </p><p>
   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
   using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
   PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
   transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
   include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
   proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
   HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Title Page</span>”</span> means, for a printed book, the title page
   itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
   material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Title
   Page</span>”</span> means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
   work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </p><p>
   A section <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> means a named subunit of the
   Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
   parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here
   XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Dedications</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Endorsements</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span>.) To
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Preserve the Title</span>”</span> of such a section when you modify the
   Document means that it remains a section <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span>
   according to this definition.
  </p><p>
   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
   states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
   Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
   but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
   these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
   meaning of this License.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.7"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.7"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">VERBATIM COPYING</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.7">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
   the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
   conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
   measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
   copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
   exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
   you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </p><p>
   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
   may publicly display copies.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.8"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.8"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">COPYING IN QUANTITY</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.8">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
   printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
   Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
   the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
   back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
   publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
   with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
   other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
   the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
   satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
   respects.
  </p><p>
   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
   you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
   actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </p><p>
   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
   along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
   access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
   latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
   at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
   (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
   public.
  </p><p>
   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
   them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.9"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.9"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">MODIFICATIONS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.9">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
   Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
   filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
   modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
   In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">A. </span>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
    if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
    You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
    publisher of that version gives permission.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">B. </span>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
    (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they
    release you from this requirement.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">C. </span>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
    Version, as the publisher.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">D. </span>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">E. </span>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
    the other copyright notices.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">F. </span>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
    of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">G. </span>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">H. </span>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">I. </span>
    Preserve the section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span>, Preserve its
    Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
    authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
    Page. If there is no section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span> in the
    Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
    the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
    Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">J. </span>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span> section. You may omit
    a network location for a work that was published at least four years
    before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
    it refers to gives permission.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">K. </span>
    For any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Acknowledgments</span>”</span> or
    <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Dedications</span>”</span>, Preserve the Title of the section, and
    preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
    contributor acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">L. </span>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">M. </span>
    Delete any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Endorsements</span>”</span>. Such a section
    may not be included in the Modified Version.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">N. </span>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Endorsements</span>”</span> or to conflict in title with any Invariant
    Section.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">O. </span>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p><p>
   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
   the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
   sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
   Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These
   titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
  </p><p>
   You may add a section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Endorsements</span>”</span>, provided it
   contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
   approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.
  </p><p>
   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
   and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
   by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
   same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
   entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
   replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
   that added the old one.
  </p><p>
   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="id-1.4.5.2.10"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.5.2.10"><span xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager" class="name">COMBINING DOCUMENTS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk02ar03.html#id-1.4.5.2.10">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
   them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
   notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </p><p>
   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
   If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
   contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
   of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
   that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
   to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
   notice of the combined work.
  </p><p>
   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span> in the various original documents, forming one
   section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span>; likewise combine any sections
   Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>, and any sections Entitled

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
   the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
   verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </p><p>
   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
   it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
   License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
   respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
   copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
   rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works
   permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
   not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
   derivative works of the Document.
  </p><p>
   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
   of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
   aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
   bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
   of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
   appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
   their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
   Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
   Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and
   all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
   provided that you also include the original English version of this
   License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
   case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
   of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
   prevail.
  </p><p>
   If a section in the Document is Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">Dedications</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">History</span>”</span>, the requirement
   (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
   changing the actual title.

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
   as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
   who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
   Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
  </p><p>
   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
   the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
   <span class="quote">“<span class="(quote)">or any later version</span>”</span> applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
   any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
   by the Free Software Foundation.

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
   License in the document and put the following copyright and license
   notices just after the title page:
  </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU
Free Documentation License”.</pre></div><p>
   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
   replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:
  </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre></div><p>
   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
   combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
   situation.
  </p><p>
   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
   software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their
   use in free software.
