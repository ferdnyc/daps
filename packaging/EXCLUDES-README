README for "exclude-files_for_daps_package"

Since the aforementioned file itself does not allow comments, some information
on why particular files are included or excluded is collected here:

+ contrib/: collection of files that are not necessary to use DAPS

+ doc/design-notes/: process diagrams showing DAPS's inner workings, possibly
   outdated and not relevant for users

+ doc/presentation/: conference presentations about DAPS that are not strictly
   DAPS documentation

+ packaging/: files that are needed for packaging, some of which are shipped
   inside the DAPS package, but need to be placed outside the TAR archive

+ test/: test cases that are made to be run from the Git repository

+ *.~/*~: temporary files
